d3rlpy - A data-driven deep reinforcement learning library as an out-of-the-box tool.
=====================================================================================

`d3rlpy <https://github.com/takuseno/d3rlpy>`_ is a easy-to-use data-driven
deep reinforcement learning library.

.. code-block::

  $ pip install d3rlpy

d3rlpy provides state-of-the-art data-driven deep reinforcement learning
algorithms through out-of-the-box scikit-learn-style APIs.
Unlike other RL libraries, the provided algorithms can achieve extremely
powerful performance beyond the paper via several tweaks.

These are the design principles of d3rlpy:

* d3rlpy is desined for practical projects.
* d3rlpy provides state-of-the-art techniques across RL researches to
  let everyone easily achieve an incredible performance.
* d3rlpy provides scikit-learn-compatible APIs.
