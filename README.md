d3rlpy is a data-driven deep reinforcement learning library as an out-of-the-box tool.

```py
from d3rlpy.dataset import MDPDataset
from d3rlpy.algos import CQL

# MDPDataset takes arrays of state transitions
dataset = MDPDataset(observations, actions, rewards, terminals)

# train data-driven deep RL
cql = CQL()
cql.fit(dataset.episodes)

# ready to control
actions = cql.predict(x)
```

## key features

### :zap: Most Practical RL Library Ever
- **offline RL**: d3rlpy supports state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms. Offline RL is extremely powerful when the online interaction is not feasible during training (e.g. robotics, medical).
- **online RL**: d3rlpy also supports conventional state-of-the-art online training algorithms without any compromising, which means that you can solve any kinds of RL problems only with `d3rlpy`.
- **advanced engineering**: d3rlpy is designed to implement the faster and efficient training algorithms. For example, you can train Atari environments with x4 less memory space and as fast as the fastest RL library.

### :beginner: Easy-To-Use API
- **zero-knowledge of DL library**: d3rlpy provides many state-of-the-art algorithms through intuitive APIs. You can become a RL engineer even without knowing how to use deep learning libraries.
- **scikit-learn compatibility**: d3rlpy is not only easy, but also completely compatible with scikit-learn API, which means that you can maximize your productivity with the useful scikit-learn's utilities.

### :rocket: Beyond State-Of-The-Art
- **distributional Q function**: d3rlpy is the first library that supports distributional Q functions in the all algorithms. The distributional Q function is known as the very powerful method to achieve the state-of-the-performance.
- **many tweek options**: d3rlpy is also the first to support N-step TD backup, ensemble value functions and data augmentation in the all algorithms, which lead you to the place no one ever reached yet.

## scikit-learn compatibility
This library is designed as if born from scikit-learn.
You can fully utilize scikit-learn's utilities to increase your productivity.
```py
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from d3rlpy.metrics.scorer import td_error_scorer

train_episodes, test_episodes = train_test_split(dataset)

cql.fit(train_episodes,
        eval_episodes=test_episodes,
        scorers={'td_error': td_error_scorer})
```

You can naturally perform cross-validation.
```py
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_validate

scores = cross_validate(cql, dataset, scoring={'td_error': td_error_scorer})
```

And more.
```py
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

gscv = GridSearchCV(estimator=cql,
                    param_grid={'actor_learning_rate': [3e-3, 3e-4, 3e-5]},
                    scoring={'td_error': td_error_scorer},
                    refit=False)
gscv.fit(train_episodes)
```
